They were diagnosed with an incurable condition. To add insult to injury, the prognosis was off by several years. When he passed, we had a service for him that provided some closure but I felt that there were things on my mind and conscience that I couldn’t bring myself to talk about at the time: call it cowardice or a sense of propriety. I think I can do a better job this time. I believe my friend deserves to have his story told, needles and all, because it made his final moments that much more dignified.\nI have only just decided to publish this… eulogy. I stayed up a lot thinking about whether it was necessary or even potentially hurtful to publish this piece. His family has asked that I don’t reveal his identity (for reasons that will become obvious later).\nWe met at choir but I don’t think I made the best impression: “wouldn’t notice you missing” (my friend, 2013). However, upon learning that I had the lungs of a swimmer, my friend invited me to a group of whistlers. It’s there that I became familiar with him and the other whistlers. He was one of the first people I met that truly loved life: an unquenching curiosity coupled with a humility that I only appreciated with maturity. I was surrounded by classmates that either ridiculed that romantic pursuit of knowledge or framed that pursuit in a self-aggrandizing way. The environment made me cynical, myopic and a bully. With him, I could finally let my venom molt: my ambitions weren’t laughing matters and nor were my insecurities. He was open about his problems as well - he never hid his demons from me. I got to see a mature, intelligent and curious person and it changed my entire worldview. My cynicism transformed to hope to wonder.\nOne day, he mentioned feeling unwell and visited the doctor. After weeks of testing, the damning results came in: he was diagnosed with an incurable condition - one that had an uncompromising expiry date. The doctor gave him two years if he was careful. He’d been saving money for university and now there was a very small chance he would actually get to go, so why even bother going to school? It was heartbreaking to see how quickly he had become resigned and how deeply detached he was from his prior dreams.\nAfter the initial shock subsided, he decided to start checking off items on his bucket list. He’d always wanted to go explore the world. He was obsessed with learning about different cultures and traditions. More than anything, he believed that fashion was an effective signal to gauge societal shifts and would often argue about the understated role of fashion. For example, in the War of 1812, soldiers would fumble with both hands with their buttons when they needed to relieve themselves and consequently put their guns down. Some of these soldiers died, presumably because they were too unlucky. To think that buttons could’ve changed the tide of a monumental war…\nAt the end of the two years, we visited him to say our final farewells. We even had a small funeral service where he judged our choice of cake among other things: “you’re wearing that… to my funeral!?” I miss his humor the most. But he didn’t pass away that year. Or the year after. I can’t imagine what that felt like: waking up every day, not knowing if it’s going to be your last day. He described it best (I’m paraphrasing because it’s been a while): “It’s like I live the same day on repeat. There’s no planning for the future. It’s just this endless waiting.” Still disillusioned by the prospect of living for the future, he still skipped school and started hanging around a different crowd.\nHe started using drugs. Eventually started abusing drugs. He started running out of funds and his parents were, understandably, not too keen on indulging a drug habit. I was militant about drug use and slowly and painfully decided I wanted nothing to do with this death spiral. He came to me, asking for a loan I knew he had no intention of paying back. He started asking others for money. Soon, he became easily irritable. Felt he was entitled to it on account of our friendship or his condition. When that stopped working, he started becoming more violent and one of the whistlers started noticing things missing. To my everlasting shame, I broke off contact at this point. We held an intervention, but it backfired as he thought it was too disingenuous. We wished he had recognized the brilliance and strength everyone else saw in him. Drugs managed to enter his life, addict him, take control of his mind, make him sick, and finally destroy him.\nI don’t think it was one thing that crushed him: his condition, losing his friends, disappointment and pity from his parents, abandoning his dreams… death from a thousand cuts. I don’t think I reached out in the right way. I have a terrible habit of helping unsolicited and I’m coming to terms with how it can undermine someone’s agency. While this was never my intention, I imagine it didn’t help him in the slightest.\nI met him a few years later at the insistence of another whistler and while I recognized remnants of my old friend, he wasn’t completely reconciled. There was something missing: he was still stuck in that endless nightmare while the world had moved on. In us, he could see the life that was ripped away from him. That and pity. He hated being pitied the most. His cynicism was almost palpable. I could sense his self-hatred, just pure unadulterated anger and frustration in his furrowed brows. As the night wore on, I noticed more wrinkles in his brow until finally, they all disappeared. I don’t know what the tipping point was but I like to imagine it was at this meeting that he wondered whether he’d had enough of this condition dictating his life. Drugs told him it could make him feel accepted, it could make him feel alright, it could make him feel worthy, it could make him feel normal, it could make him feel loved, it could make him feel nothing and make him feel like everything will be okay. And I like to think that now he knew it was all a lie - he had never lost us, his dreams were still accessible, his parents loved him dearly… he had just lost his rudder. Determined to make up lost time, he finally went back to school.\nI started communicating more often - usually for help on his homework or school drama (that he was apparently above but still somehow knew about more intimately than his course work). I noticed his kindness and radiance returning in each call. I no longer felt I was walking on egg shells. We started meeting up online with the rest of the whistlers to belt out symphonies. By this point, he had convinced himself that the condition was just a minor inconvenience in his potentially long life.\nUnfortunately, as I learned after his passing, that wasn’t the case. A few years would go by before his condition crept back into his life.\nHis condition had regressed aggressively. Hoping to spare us another round of grief, he went to the hospital on his own. After about a week, his parents called me to give him a ride from the hospital to his home. I thought this request was odd since they lived much closer to the hospital but I later realized I was the schmuck no one had mentioned the surprise party to. On the way back, we spoke like we always did: in half rhymes and quarter tones. I saw nothing of the man that had stolen from us, nor the one who had threatened us with violence, or the one that had stopped loving life. He was at peace.

  <div class="post-content"><p>It&rsquo;s taken me some time to process this and perhaps I&rsquo;m not completely at terms with it yet: a close friend passed away a few months ago. They were diagnosed with an incurable condition. To add insult to injury, the prognosis was off by several years.

<p>I have only just decided to publish this&hellip; eulogy. I stayed up a lot thinking about whether it was necessary or even potentially hurtful to publish this piece. His family has asked that I don&rsquo;t reveal his identity (for reasons that will become obvious later).</p>
<p>We met at choir but I don&rsquo;t think I made the best impression: &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t notice you missing&rdquo; (my friend, 2013). However, upon learning that I had the lungs of a swimmer, my friend invited me to a group of <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCzyQ2Rfj1c&amp;ab_channel=Jubilee">whistlers</a></strong>.
