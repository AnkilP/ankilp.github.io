I've also had brushes with research and startups:

* Plasma attenuation for electrodeposition at Chalk River Labs
* Image Processing with Shapelet functions
* Protein modeling for prion aggregation
* Fluid modeling for nanocellulose (No one liked the name I came up with)
* Fluid modeling for cryocoolers (Intelline)
* Privacy preserving ML (EnSnif)
* Explicit vs implicit associations in curriculum learning for reinforcement learning


I love traveling and reading. I've found a way to combine the two by picking up a book written by a local author in every new city I visit. I started this 'tradition' when I impulsively went into a bookstore in Barcelona and asked them to recommend a story written by a local author. That story was [The Shadow Of The Wind](https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Wind-Carlos-Ruiz-Zaf%C3%B3n/dp/0143034901) by Zafon. I wasn't too sure I would like this genre but the librarian seemed to genuinely love the book. I've never been so happy to be wrong: it was a story within a story that referenced itself. I can only describe it as an ode to storytelling and it made me realize that I need to diversify my reading diet. Hence this tradition.

I really like podcasts where they talk about tech or policy more abstractly or romantically (as opposed to how to navigate academia, how popular a tech stack is, who's making the most money, etc.):
