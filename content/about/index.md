I've also had brushes with research and startups:

* Plasma attenuation for electrodeposition at Chalk River Labs
* Image Processing with Shapelet functions
* Protein modelling for prion aggregation
* Fluid modelling for nanocellulose (Unnamed startup)
* Fluid modelling for cryocoolers (Intelline)
* Privacy preserving ML (EnSnif)
* Explicit vs implicit associations in curriculum learning for reinforcement learning


I love travelling and reading. I've found a way to combine the two by picking up a book written by a local author in every new city I visit.
