I strongly believe that stand-ups don't make me a more productive engineer. It only reduces uncertainty for managers. If I need help, I'll ask in the slack channel. Maybe we can have a dedicated time period when everyone monitors the slack channel to help with questions. I'll update my status in the gantt chart or equivalent asynchronously. 

Agile's strengths over other management tools include being able to adapt to uncertainties and external stimuli. While I'm a big fan of those properties, I believe that agile software in general has missed the point: stories don't have any history attached to them. When I write a story that's similar to something else in the organization, how can I leverage that knowledge and work? How do we have discussions about how long a task will take in a way that's data centric?

[TODO - finish write up about my new tool that can show which new stories are connected to old ones and add the github]
