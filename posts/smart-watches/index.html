We won the Telus Prize for our work and each of us got an Apple Watch.\nI had been reading about wearables and their potential to detect biomarkers. Videos like Can you really tell if a kid is lying and posts like Smartwatch can detect early signs of illness impressed upon me a game-changing potential to make diagnoses more accurate and prognoses more reliable. As you can tell, I was very exicted to try it out. That is not to say my expectations were not tempered by what I had seen in ads (or had not seen). I understood that this kind of medical technology might not become mainstream until Apple had the requisite confidence to market it as a medical device - or rather, the data would not be accepted as such without the continued progress and maturity of the product.\nI tried it on, and it felt familiar. There were some annoying notifications reminding me to breathe (thanks watch - I almost forgot to breathe for the past 10 minutes!) but I did appreciate its reminders to get up and move around. It had to be paired to my phone and it had to be close enough to my phone to use its full capabilities. Every now and then, I would get a message from a friend or a notification about an email. I would look down at my hand, try to read it on the watch and usually, try to respond back. It is not particularly easy to respond back on the device (unless I can draw or speak which is not always easy or possible). It is usually faster for me to just pull out my phone. Naturally, if I am going to pull out my phone anyway, I might as well read the message on my phone too. Eventually, the role of the watch became limited to triaging events. If I felt like a notification was important for me to respond to now, I would answer it and if it were not, I could ignore it until I eventually pulled out my phone. I don’t know how willing I would be to buy an expensive triager… I’m not so busy that I can’t pull out my phone to shave 500 ms.\nWearing a smart watch also imposes expectations about my availability. A friend had a phone that did not quite work well, and he could only really answer messages when he got back home. It created an expectation that he was only available during certain parts of the day. If I wanted to have a rousing philosophical discussion with him, I knew that there was only a pre-determined block of time when he would be available for that. I could always call him and send him messages throughout the day, and he would only ever respond to my texts at that point in the day (he would pick up calls whenever). But if I had an expectation to have a synchronous conversation with him, it would have to be during this time. Texting/mailing/emailing/etc. made our conversations asynchronous and it created and shifted expectations about how we interact with one another. However, instant messaging has shifted those asynchronous expectations for messaging - some of my friends expect a quick answer and some do not care when I respond (so long as it is within a bounded period). I try to reciprocate those expectations, but it is not always possible if I am busy. Seeing a smart watch on my wrist shifted my friends' expectations about when I would be able to see their messages. Before I put on the watch: if I were busy, I could still look at my phone and continue working if the message did not seem urgent (“Look at this cute cat!\"). After, there was an expectation that I would at least acknowledge the message whenever my wrist vibrated (and I would consequently see the message). The expectation was that I was always available. There are a few people that I am always available for but I can’t practically do that for everyone.\nMy impression of Focus Time was that it addressed this issue by not showing notifications during a certain user-defined period. However, it’s not clear (on the platforms that have enabled this) that the sender has an indication that they are sending a message during someone else’s focus time. They might put two and two together but I’d rather not leave that to interpretation. This is an engineering problem, though, and not an indictment of the underlying product.\nThis piece is not an indictment of the technology; on the contrary, I am a big fan of wearables. I wear the watch when I go hiking and it provides a lot of utility as a fitness tracker (and it tells the time unlike this :P). Rather, this is an indictment of the expectations it creates and how the product needs to be more mature and have more utility to justify those expectations.\nAll this being said, it’s clear it provides enough utility to millions. Who knows, maybe the ubiquity of the product will shift expectations.\nWould love to chat if you feel differently (or similarly): ankil335@gmail.com\nThanks to Dhrumil Patel for looking over the piece.\n",

<p>I had been reading about wearables and their potential to detect biomarkers.
