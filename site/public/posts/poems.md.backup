I wanted to publish a short list of poems that I wrote for a class. I would love to hear feedback on them at <ankil335@gmail.com>.

(Jazz is) Controlled Chaos

Swimmers’ lungs can't compare
To the turbulence stored inside
The madness within exhaled through lullabies
Brass keys mock my inhibitions

Demon within exorcised into articulation
Sell me my soul back to
Harmonize my brash instrument to beating organ
And seduce me away from enlightenment

International X Day

It was cause for celebration recently
To commemorate well-deserved progress gleefully.
Imagine my disappointment to see some naysayers
Amongst the politically vocal taxpayers.

Too eager to miss the forest for the trees
Too eager to burn the tree for the forest
Too eager to make podiums from twigs
Too eager to compare rings between twigs

We are to aspire to greatness
Not the common denominator.

Work

Work, work, work
Like god’s forgiveness, we

Worship it
Surrender to it
Sacrifice for it

Identify by it
Belong to it
Depend on it

The theocracy of work has but one currency:
A token of my gratitude

Poem #4

Laws are like fences
---------------------------

Fences keep the honest people honest
Until it’s more practical to ignore the wire
Just don’t take away the fence promised

You can weaken the hurdle as an upper-class monetarist
And epitomize the history of the forgotten squire
Fences keep the honest people honest

You can jump the railing as a lower-class dualist
And weather the indignity of an indifferent umpire
Just don’t take away the fence promised

You can pass by the palisade as a middle-class sophist
And reflect on the shrinking stratum of empire
Fences keep the honest people honest

A veneer of trust that celebrates devest
But articulate clearly the moment to aspire
Just don’t take away the fence promised

The best laid plans of mice and men are never blest
The rules of paradise can only backfire
Fences keep the honest people honest
Just don’t take away the fence promised
