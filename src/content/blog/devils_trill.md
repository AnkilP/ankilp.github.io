description: Exploring the intersection of AI and classical music through the haunting tale of Tartini's Devil's Trill Sonata.
---

The **[Devil's Trill Sonata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkX8YyA4Wp4)**, composed by Tartini, is as famous for its thrilling music as for the supernatural legend behind it. Tartini dreamed he made a pact with the devil, and upon awakening, tried to recreate the masterpiece he heard in his dream. While he deemed the result his greatest work, it paled in comparison to the music of his vision.

This tale has inspired countless interpretations by musicians like **Kreisler**, **Pavanello**, and **Benedetti**, each seeking to capture the elusive essence of Tartini’s dream. While none of these attempts claim to uncover the original, the exercise itself is fascinating—an artistic pursuit without a ground truth.

As a mathematician once described chess as playing with the devil—where each loss reveals a new truth—so too does this story prompt us to explore the boundaries of creativity. What if AI could tackle this challenge, teasing out variations of the _Devil's Trill Sonata_ to uncover truths about art and cognition?

### Pushing the Boundaries with AI

To explore this, I’m considering procedurally generating new variations of the piece using AI. The goal isn’t to find Tartini’s original dream but to explore creative processes and see how far AI can stretch our understanding of art—much like engines once expanded our understanding of thermodynamics.

### Questions to Explore:

1. How much should we preserve from the original piece? Should rhythm or timbre take precedence?
2. Should we aim to combine elements from existing interpretations, or strive for something entirely new?
3. What can the process teach us about both AI and human creativity?

I’ll be expanding this blog with more details about my approach and linking to related projects (including work on reinforcement learning in Minecraft). In the meantime, I’d love your feedback: How would you approach this challenge? Let me know in the comments!
