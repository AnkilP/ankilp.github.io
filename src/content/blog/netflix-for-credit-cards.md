Credit cards are at a cable moment.

Netflix was an antidote to cable's sporgasburg of shows you didn't want but still paid for. On top of that, it was a lot more expensive and you had to subscribe to a lot of other cable companies to get the shows you wanted. The tv entertainment landscape was fragmented and inefficient, propped up only by the market effects of severe consolidation.

This is part of a larger phenomenon in America. Everything is fragmented: medical, finance, health, banking, identity... On one hand, it's locally optimal; enterprising problem solvers can solve niche issues for demographics that aren't being served.
