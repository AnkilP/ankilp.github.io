description: Exploring why stand-up meetings might hinder productivity for engineers and proposing a tool to make Agile more data-driven.
---

Meetings, especially stand-ups, are often touted as productivity tools. However, as an engineer, I’ve found them counterproductive—serving managers more than teams. Let’s explore a better way.

Stand-ups don’t make me a more productive engineer. They reduce uncertainty for managers but do little for the engineering process. When I need help, I ask in Slack—direct, efficient, and immediate. What if, instead of daily stand-ups, we had a dedicated time each day where everyone monitored Slack for questions and updates? Asynchronous updates in a Gantt chart or equivalent tool could replace real-time status reports.

### Agile’s Missed Opportunities

Agile is great at adapting to uncertainties and external stimuli, but it often falls short in leveraging organizational knowledge. Stories lack history—there’s no way to connect them to past work. How can we discuss task durations in a way that’s data-driven? How can we avoid reinventing the wheel when a similar task has been tackled elsewhere in the organization?

### A New Approach

[Here, introduce your tool and how it solves these challenges. Highlight how it connects new and old stories, enabling data-driven discussions and better knowledge sharing.]
