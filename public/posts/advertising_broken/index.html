			<p>When you hear personalized ads, you think the ad itself has been personalized for you. However, it&rsquo;s the distribution of the ad that&rsquo;s been personalized. The company can choose to offer you a different ad based on user group preferences. While I believe having the granularity of user group preferences is great, I think it misses the point - we need to flip the model. This is not to say that all advertising is broken or ineffective. My point is that some means of advertising can be more potent.</p>
<p>Suppose I need shoes. Nike makes shoes. However, I don&rsquo;t buck to peer pressure and I couldn&rsquo;t care less which basketball player was shilling the next shoe. I care about function more than form. I want orthopedic shoes. Can Nike still sell me the same product? Their shoes are great and might even fit the criteria but I&rsquo;ll never consider them because they don&rsquo;t advertise themselves as such. What if Nike made an ad for the same shoe but framed it in a way that was more amenable to me? What if there was a way to make this procedurally?</p>
<p>This is a fairly contrived example so let&rsquo;s talk about Salesforce competitors. There&rsquo;s a lot of CRMs out there and they basically do the same thing. Why aren&rsquo;t real estate brokers using Salesforce, as opposed to a bespoke real estate CRM? I imagine it&rsquo;s because the new CRM is easier to use and fits their use cases better. But also because they don&rsquo;t associate Salesforce with their use cases.</p>
<p>I believe that the reason adblocks are gaining so much popularity is simply because ads suck. They&rsquo;re not interactive, personally meaningful and generic. If an <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/uwvAgDCOdU4?t=117">ad</a></strong> decides to leverage a social movement, they sometimes grossly mischaracterize the movement. They have all the refinements of a good production but without any of the substance that merits it so much screen time. At this point, I will remember an ad simply because I&rsquo;ve seen it so often. I would argue that it&rsquo;s wasteful to show me 10 forgettable ads than one memorable ad.</p>
<p>This is where I take a bit of a tangent because I have a solution in mind that solves many problems, including this: privacy-preserving digital identity and generative AI.</p>
<p>[TODO - talk about how privacy preserving digital identity can make it possible to serve truly personalized ads]</p>
