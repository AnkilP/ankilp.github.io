			<p>While walking by a billboard of a large tech company, I noticed that underneath that billboard, sat several encampments. I start to wonder what the point of the ad is. I see them plastered everywhere in the city - it&rsquo;s not like someone is going to miss the company. More generally, I wondered how relevant that company was in the community it was advertising in.</p>
<p>Why not take the marketing budget and reallocate it to funding microloans to start businesses, help pay utility bills or rent, etc.?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s $10,000 from Coca-Cola to help keep the lights on&rdquo;</p>
<p>With microloans, there&rsquo;s also the promise of getting back some of the money that&rsquo;s loaned out plus interest. On top of that, there&rsquo;s great publicity for creating a program like this - although, the first company to do this will take the lion share of the goodwill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve largely felt microloans as a concept have only recently gained serious attention in North America, although mostly from crowd-sourced apps and not entrenched banks.</p>
<p>[TODO - talk about future of microloans, what&rsquo;s needed to get NA there (legislation, partners, etc.)]</p>
<p>I think advertising itself can be reframed more abstractly - what is advertising? Why limit it to microloans?</p>
