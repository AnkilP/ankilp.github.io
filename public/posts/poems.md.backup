I wanted to publish a short list of poems that I wrote for a class. I would love to hear feedback on them at <ankil335@gmail.com>.

International X Day

It was cause for celebration recently
To commemorate well-deserved progress gleefully.
Imagine my disappointment to see some naysayers
Amongst the politically vocal taxpayers.

Too eager to miss the forest for the trees!
Too eager to burn the tree for the forest!
Too eager to make podiums from twigs!

We are to aspire to excellence
Not the common denominator.

Tide and time are more patient than me.
~~~
I initially wrote this after International Women's Day but later realized that it unfortunately applied to a lot of different scenarios.

(Jazz is) Controlled Chaos

Drowners' lungs can't compare
To the turbulence stored inside
The madness within exhaled into lullabies

O' demon within, exorcised into articulation,
Sell me my soul back to
Harmonize this brash instrument to beating organ
~~~
I love jazz and I absolutely love playing the alto sax. The way I connect to the music with a piano is through the sound and my hands but with wind instruments, it also involved my breath, the giver of life, to make music. That connection has always been very special for me.

Work

Work, work, work
Like god’s forgiveness, we

Worship it
Surrender to it
Sacrifice for it

Identify by it
Belong to it
Depend on it

The theocracy of work has but one currency:
A token of my gratitude
~~~
I might have written this in frustration.

Laws are like fences

Fences keep the honest people honest
Until it’s more practical to ignore the wire
Just don’t take away the fence promised

You can weaken the hurdle as an upper-class monetarist
And epitomize the etymology of entitlement
Fences keep the honest people honest

You can jump the railing as a lower-class dualist
And weather the indignity of indifference
Just don’t take away the fence promised

You can pass by the palisade as a middle-class sophist
And reflect on the shrinking stratum
Fences keep the honest people honest

A veneer of trust that celebrates devest
But articulate clearly the ethos to aspire
Just don’t take away the fence promised

The best laid plans of mice and men are never blest
The rules of paradise can never nice
Fences keep the honest people honest
Just don’t take away the fence promised
~~~
I've always been a bit cynical about the law and its usefulness and I hope this poem conveys some of that frustration.

Northern Lights

Dancing acrobats
Clad in malachite
Streak the sky
With wondrous glee
 
To unspoken applause the dancers bow
Until daybreak, they whisper their stories
Imparting their wisdom to the north wind
And wayward trekkers on distant voyages
-------------------------------------------
New stories 
Are born from old
Spinning 
Thread from 
The entrails
Of stars
And 
Old Wisdoms
~~~
Boy scouts have been such a formative experience for me that I couldn't pass on an opportunity to write a poem about seeing the northern lights on a camping trip.
